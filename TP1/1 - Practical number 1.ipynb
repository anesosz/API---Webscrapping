They serve as bridges that allow applications to interact with each other seamlessly, enabling the creation of more robust and interconnected software.\n",
    "\n",
    "APIs come in various forms, each serving specific purposes in the realm of software development. Let's explore some fundamental concepts:"

   "source": [
    "- **Question 1:** *Name three types of API protocols. Briefly explain the primary use of each.*\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **REST**: It's a common way for systems to talk to each other using URLs and HTTP (like how browsers work). Great for web apps.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **SOAP**: It's older and more strict. It uses XML and is often used in big companies for secure data sharing.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **GraphQL**: Lets you ask for just the data you need. Great for apps with lots of connected data (like social media META ).\n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Question 2:** *What are the HTTP response code families? And what do they mean?*\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **1xx(Informational)**: The server is thinking and still working on your request.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **22xx(Success)**: Yay! Your request worked.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **3xx(Redirection)**: The thing you asked for is somewhere else.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **4xx(Client Error)**: You made a mistake like asking for something that doesn’t exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **5xx(Server Error)**: Try again later.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Understanding these families helps developers diagnose and troubleshoot issues during API interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Question 3:** *What do the HTTP response codes 201, 401, and 404 mean?*\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **201(Created):** Something new was created successfully like adding a new user.\n",
    "  - **401(Unauthorized):** You’re not logged in or don’t have permission to see this.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **404(Not Found):** The thing you’re looking for isn’t there.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Question 4:** *Name the 4 basic HTTP verbs.*\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **GET:** Retrieve data from a resource.\n",
    "  - **POST:** Submit data to create a resource.\n",
    "  - **PUT:** Update or replace a resource entirely.\n",
    "  - **DELETE:** Remove a resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Question 5:** *Explain the difference between PUT and PATCH?*\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **PUT:** Updates an entire resource. Example: Replace the whole user profile.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **PATCH:** Partially updates a resource. Example: Change only the user’s email.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Question 6:** *Name at least two data formats commonly used in API exchanges.*\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **JSON:** Easy-to-read format that looks like a list or dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **XML:** More detailed but harder to read. Used in older systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Question 7:** *How can you verify the validity of a resource without getting the entire response?*\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Use **HEAD**: It only fetches the \"header\" info like file size or last update (metadata) without getting the full data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Question 8:** *What are the main concepts of REST? (name them)*\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Client-Server:** The client (you) and server are separate.\n",
    "  - **Stateless:** No saving info about you between requests.\n",
    "  - **Cacheable:** Save responses so you don’t need to ask again.\n",
    "  - **Uniform Interface:** Everyone follows the same rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Question 9:** *Can you explain one of the main concepts of your choice from among those you mention? (Give an example if possible)*\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Statelessness:** The server doesn’t remember who you are.\n",
    "**Example:** Every time you ask for something, you send your info like an API key so the server knows what to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the subsequent sections, we will delve into practical exercises to apply and deepen our understanding of these concepts using SOAP, REST, and GraphQL APIs.\n"

    "# Exploring SOAP APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Few elements to remember about the SOAP Protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "The SOAP protocol, which means Simple Object Access Protocol, is one of the earliest web service protocols. SOAP is an XML-based protocol and was designed to provide a platform/language-independent way to exchange data between different systems over the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts in SOAP:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **XML-Based Structure:** SOAP messages are structured using XML, making them both human-readable and machine-readable. This structure allows for the encapsulation of data and its transport between systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Platform and Language Independence:** One of the core objectives of SOAP is to provide a communication method that is independent of the underlying platform or programming language. This promotes interoperability between diverse systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Message Format:** SOAP messages consist of an envelope that defines the message structure and rules for processing, a set of encoding rules for data types, and conventions for representing remote procedure calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Transport Neutrality:** SOAP can be used with various transport protocols, including HTTP, SMTP, and more. This flexibility in transport makes it adaptable to different network environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "Obtain and display the capital of the Canada corresponding to the ISO code \"CA\" using the following SOAP API. \n",
    "Step by step guide :\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 1:** Examine the XML structure of the SOAP request provided. Identify the tag name that contains the ISO country code and the tag that will return the capital name.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 2:** Modify the existing SOAP request to use the ISO code \"CA\" isntead of \"FR\". Ensure that the XML structure remains correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 3:** Use the modified request to send a request to the SOAP services at the specified URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 4:** Analyze the response received. Extract and display the capital name from the SOAP response.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 5:** Remove sections of code that are not necessary to achieve this objective, in order to simply the script.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Few elements to remember about the REST Protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. RESTful APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) conform to the principles of REST, allowing systems to communicate over HTTP in a stateless manner; Some important aspects are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Resources:** Everything is a resource, identified by a unique URI.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Basic HTTP Methods:** One of the core objectives of SOAP is to provide a communication method that is independent of the underlying platform or programming language. This promotes interoperability between diverse systems.\n",
